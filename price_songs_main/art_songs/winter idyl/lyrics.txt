The dry-lipped grass curls back
And bares the pitted stones
And the tree in its new lack
Bares now its angular bones
Man looks and looks away 
From earth to a bleak sky
Where, high above the day
Where high above the sky
The last geese going by
Pass the horizon's rim
And man remembering where
A door will welcome him
Turns, turns, turns, in the darkening air
And takes him there
