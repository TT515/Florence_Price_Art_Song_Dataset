When daylight fades
Gray shadows fall
And evening shades
The moonbeams call
I look above
There hanging high
Is a little star
In a cloudless sky
It seems to say:

"The setting sun
Has dropped away
The day is done
Now shadows play"
A mystic spell
Comes over me
I long to tell
My love for thee
But you are far away
Gone to stay
That is what you say
But, dear, I still am true
Loving you, more and more each day
So why forget
The love we knew
For I am still
Just loving you
