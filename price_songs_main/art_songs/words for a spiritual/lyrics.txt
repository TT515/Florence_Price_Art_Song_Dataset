Slow me down, Lawd
Ah's agoin' too fast
Ah can't see mah brother when he's walkin' past
Ah miss a lot a' good things
Ah miss a lot a' good things day by day
Ah don't know a blessing when it comes my way
Slow me down, Lawd
Ah wants to see
More o' the things that's good for me
A little less o' me an' a little more a' You
Ah wants the heavenly atmosphere to trickle through
Let me help a brother when the goin's rough
Let me help a brother when the goin's rough
When folks work together it aint so tough
Slow me down, Lawd
Slow me down, Lawd so ah can talk with some a Yo angels
Slow me down to walk
Slow me down
