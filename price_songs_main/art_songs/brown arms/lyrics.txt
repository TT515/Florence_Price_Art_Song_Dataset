Listen, oh brown kind mother
I am weary and I would rest.
Put your old warm arms about me
Let me lie on your withered breast
I am very sick of cities
Of faces cold and strange
I long for your sunwashed spaces,
Blue skies, and windswept range

I am sick of the huddled houses
And the selfish hearts of men
Put your warm kind arms about me
Let me lie on your heart again
