Dip, swallow, dip
By the grey steeps of Hearn
Brave the abyss at the sky
Flicker and soar on your slim painted pinions
Probing the deeps that are high

Skim, Martin skim
Over the ceilings vast reaches
Plummet your way down the height
Plunge through the vapor peans rosy with sunset
Fleeing the realms of the night

Swift be your flight
Down the endless grey skyways
Etched like a paint in the dome
Sweep down some lane to the misty horizon
Climb to the zenith your home
