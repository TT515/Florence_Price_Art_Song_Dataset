Oh by and by
By and by
I'm gonna lay down my heavy load
Oh by and by
By and by
I'm gonna lay down my heavy load

The river of Jordan ain't got no bounds
I'm gonna lay down my heavy load
If you ain't got Jordan you'll surely drown
I'm goin' to lay down my heavy load

Oh by and by
By and by
I'm gonna lay down my heavy load
Oh by and by
By and by
I'm gonna lay down my heavy load

Some of these mornings, bright and fair
I'm gonna lay down my heavy load
Going to put on my wings and try the air
I'm gonna lay down my heavy load
