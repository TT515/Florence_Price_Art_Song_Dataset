Close beside the meeting waters
Long ago I stood as in a dream
Watching how the little river
Fell into the broader stream
Calm and still the mingled current
Glided to the sea
On its breast serenely pictured
Floating cloud and skirting tree
And I thought:
"O human spirit!
Strong and deep and pure and blest
Let the stream of my existence
Blend with thine and find its rest!"
I could die as dies the river
In that current deep and wide
I would live as live its waters
Flashing from a stronger tide
Close beside the meeting waters
Long ago I stood as in a dream
Watching how the little river
Fell into the broader stream
