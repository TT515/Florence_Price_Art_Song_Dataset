String stars for pearls on a ribbon of whim
And fling it about her shoulders
Carve cups from coral and crust each brim
Till the whole gem smokes and smolders
Bring gold for beating in thick bright rings
And honey from hearts of clover
But love will long for the absent things
Ever the old earth over
Go, ride the world, in a glory of wars
And startle the gods to wonder
Break men to follow triumphant cars
With a rose paved road thereunder
Pile stone on stone for the fruit of a name
When a thousand years discover
But love will lean to a smaller flame
Forever and forever
