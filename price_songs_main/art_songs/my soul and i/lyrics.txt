We sit alone
On the pearldust couch on the shore
My soul and I
Nor watch the golden pyres tired in the West
Where sunrays die
My soul and I
The seagulls ski far down the crags of foam
Like arcs in flight
But we are balmed
In a shadow of dreams
That dusk the sight
Though thick white pythons of tide thresh in
And ships crawl by
And night lets slip
Venetian blinds
We dream, My soul and I, we dream.
