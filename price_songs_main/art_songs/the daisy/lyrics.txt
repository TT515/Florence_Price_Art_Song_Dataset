Little Pega Ramsay
With the yellow hair
Double ruff about her neck
And never a frock to wear
Opens to the sunbeam
Curtises to the bee
Dances when the bobolink
Awakes the world with glee
Little Pega Ramsay
Say, before you close
Do you ever droop your head
And wish you were a rose?
Little Pega Ramsay
Nodding in the wheat
Could it make you happier
To call you Marguerite
