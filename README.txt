This repository includes 112 songs by Florence B Price. The songs were manually transcribed into Musescore from Price's manuscripts, which the author accessed through the University of Arkansas David W. Mullins Library and the University of Pennsylvania Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts.

106 of the songs are completed songs written for solo voice and piano. We put these songs in the price_songs_main folder, which is separated into two folders: one for songs Price originally composed, and one for songs, primarily African American folk songs, that Price arranged for solo voice and piano. The first file contains 95 songs and the second contains 11 arrangements.

We create a folder for each song that includes: 1) the digitized score in Musescore, MIDI, and MusicXML format, 2) a PDF of the digitized score, 3) the lyrics for each song, 4) a pair of "onsets" files that denote the bar-wise section boundaries of the song as perceived by the two annotators, and 5) a "metadata" file that includes the tempo of the song, the lyricist, and subjective judgment of the following: whether the song is happy or sad, another adjective to describe the song’s mood, and the song’s musical style. Some of the songs contain repeats, for such songs, we have four "onsets" files denoting the bar-wise section boundaries; two based on the written value of the bars and two based on the performed value of the bars.

6 songs are in a separate folder; they are either incomplete, not scored for solo voice and piano, or both. For these songs, we only include the Musescore file of the digitized score.

3 of the scores were edited by the author from scores available under a CC0 license on Musescore's website. The scores were originally typeset by Owain Evans. These are:

Travels End, Forever, Fantasy in Purple

All other scores were typeset by the first author.

In the dataset we use oboe as a substitute to voice. This is consistent with practice in the majority of the OpenScore Lieder Corpus. We recognize this causes confusion, especially in the PDF files of the songs.

Copyright Procedures:

By the US Copyright Law, music works published between 1925 and 1977, and which had their copyright renewed, are under copyright 95 years from the year of publication. That means as of 2025, works published before 1930 have entered the public domain. Unpublished and unregistered works are under copyright until 70 years after the composer’s death, meaning Florence Price’s unpublished works entered the public domain on Jan. 1, 2024, over 70 years after her death in 1953.
We list the music for solo voice and piano that was published after Jan. 1, 1930. Note that we could not access documentation for the renewal of the copyrights, but to avoid the risk of copyright infringement, we leave these 17 songs out of the Florence Price Art Song Dataset as well as the training dataset for the Florence Price Piano Accompaniment Generator.
