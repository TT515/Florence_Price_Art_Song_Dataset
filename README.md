- University of Arkansas ‚Äì David W. Mullins Library  
- University of Pennsylvania ‚Äì Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts

## Dataset Structure

### üìÅ `price_songs_main/` (107 complete songs)
Organized into three subfolders:

1. **Original Compositions**: 95 songs composed by Price  
2. **Arrangements**: 11 songs arranged by Price, primarily African American folk songs
3. **Thou Art**: This song composed by Price for voice, piano, and cello is separated from the songs composed for voice and piano. We only include the MuseScore file for this song.

Each song folder includes:

- MuseScore file (`.mscz`)  
- MIDI and MusicXML files  
- PDF of the digitized score  
- Lyrics in plain text  
- Two "onsets" files denoting bar-wise section boundaries from two annotators  
- A `metadata` file including:
  - Tempo  
  - Lyricist  
  - Subjective mood annotations:  
    - Happy/Sad  
    - Descriptive adjective  
    - Musical style

#### Audio Files

We recognize the need for audio files of the songs for some researchers. Therefore, we include `audio_script.py`, a script that can render audio for each of the Musescore files in the repository. Please note that rendering the audio for all 112 songs takes a significant amount of time (~1 hour).

> üîÅ **For songs with repeats**, four "onsets" files are included: two based on the **written** bar values, and two based on the **performed** values. See list of songs with repeats below.

### üìÅ `price_songs_incomplete/` (6 songs)
These are either incomplete or not scored for solo voice and piano. For each, we include only the `.mscz` file.

### üìù Edited Scores
Three scores were originally typeset by **Owain Evans** under a CC0 license on MuseScore:

- *Travels End*  
- *Forever*  
- *Fantasy in Purple*

All remaining scores were typeset by the first author.

## Notation Details

In the dataset, **oboe** is used as a substitute for the voice part.  
This is consistent with practices in datasets like the [OpenScore Lieder Corpus](https://github.com/MarkGotham/Lieder).
