Like Jesus, like Jesus;
No you won't find a man like Jesus.
Like Jesus, like Jesus;
No you won't find a man like Jesus.
You may search from sea to sea,
But this thing is clear to me,
That you won't find a man like Jesus. 
You may search up in the air,
But you will not find him there,
No, you won't find a man like Jesus. 
Like Jesus, like Jesus;
No you won't find a man like Jesus.
No you won't find a man like Jesus.
