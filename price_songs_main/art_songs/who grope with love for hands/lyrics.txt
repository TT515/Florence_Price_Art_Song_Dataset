Who grope with love for hands, outstretched to light
Will break their fumbling fingers on a wall
Oh, in that fierce flash of pain the wise see all
The nested robin and the nested sea
The silent broaden of Eternity
Marbled in azure that nor speaks nor sings
And nest their souls beneath those flightless wings
