I saw a white bird flying
Against the evening sky
It might have been a heron
Lonely as you and I
It might have been a figment
Of a tired bewildered mind
But the bird was headed homeward
Leaving the world behind
It might have been the spirit
Of one whose sleep that day
Had overflowed the borders
Of mortal flesh and clay
