Death is going to lay his cold icy hands on me
Lord! on me
Death is going to lay his cold icy hands on me

One morning I was walking along
I heard a voice and saw no man
Said go in peace and sin no more
Your sins forgiven and your soul set free
One of these mornings I won't be long
You'll look for me and I'll be gone
Yes one of these mornings about twelve o'clock
This old world is going to reel and rock
