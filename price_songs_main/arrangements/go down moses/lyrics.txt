Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's land,
tell old Pharaoh: Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's land,
tell old Pharaoh: Let my people go.
When Israel was in Egypt's land,
Let my people go,
oppressed so hard they could not stand,
Let my people go.
Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's land,
tell old Pharaoh: Let my people go.
O let my people go!
