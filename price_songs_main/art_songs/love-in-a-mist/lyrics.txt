Love-in-a-mist of doubt was lost
The wildwood paths were all criss-crossed
This way or that?
O, where was she?
And which path led to the trysting tree?
A green elf whispered right in her ear
"Are you sure your lover is quite sincere?"
Lovers are seldom what they seem
And love itself is a haunting dream
But a little blind god lived in the wood
Unseen, unheard, in the path he stood
A feather, dropped from an angel's wing
With speed he placed in his magic sling!
Straight into the heart of the maid it flew!
Faith lived. Ah! Doubt vanished, the world was new.
Heaven's glory marked the path to her trust
And never again was love in a mist
