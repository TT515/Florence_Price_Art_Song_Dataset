I have a mother, gone to glory,
I have a mother, gone to glory,
I have a mother, gone to glory,
On the other shore.

Bye and bye, I’ll go to meet her,
Bye and bye, I’ll go to meet her,
Bye and bye, I’ll go to meet her,
On the other shore.

Won’t that be a happy meetin’,
Won’t that be a happy meetin’,
Won’t that be a happy meetin’,
On the other shore.

There we’ll see our good old neighbors,
There we’ll see our good old neighbors,
There we’ll see our good old neighbors,
On the other shore.

There we’ll see our blessed Savior,
There we’ll see our blessed Savior,
There we’ll see our blessed Savior,
On the other shore.
