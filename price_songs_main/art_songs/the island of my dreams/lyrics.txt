The things I have seen in my dreams
I can never see again
So each day, I just pray to be taken away
To my island of dreams
Ah! The things I have heard in my dreams
I can never hear again
So I drift along on the lilt of a song
Back to the island of my dreams
Where the birds are always singing
In a garden full of flowers
And you are there, sweetheart of mine
Amid the rosy bowers
And every hour is heavenly bliss
With you and love's own kiss
On the island of my dreams
