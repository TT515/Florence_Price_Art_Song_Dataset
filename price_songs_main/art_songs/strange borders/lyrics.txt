They have walked slowly
Where they walked before
Noting the well-known steps, the elm trees shade
Where they loitered
And the church door
Let them remember slowly
Do not thrust the little thorns of old remembered joys
Into their hearts too soon
Those joys were dust
If some brief interval their smile is lost
Attend to silence, be a voiceless bird
Within a garden close
It may be they have crossed strange borders
Never crossed by spoken word
Seeing what is not seen
Hearing what is not heard
