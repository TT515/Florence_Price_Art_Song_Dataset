As we pass through life
With joy and strife
Every thing has a scheme
In this world of dreams
Then why complain or try explain
I'll simply say that I love only you

Every dream has a scheme
Every rose has a theme
Every heartbeat is love for you, dear
Every star high above
Knows that I am in love 
With someone: that someone is you

A breeze through the trees
A sigh from the seas
The same old story, dear
Each dream, each scheme and every theme
Is of you, tis my love for you
