There’s a new wind a-blowin’ Down on Tobacco Road. 
There’s a new Hope a-growin’ For them folks by name o’ Joad.

There’s a new truth we’ll be knowin’ that will lift our heavy load. 
When we find out What the working class can do.

There’s a new day a-comin’ For the poor and unemployed, 
New tunes we’ll be hummin’ From our hearts so overjoyed.

As we march we’ll be a-drummin’ How our trouble’s been destroyed 
when we find out what the working class can do.

All day long I’ve labored All my whole life through 
Ask the boss man for a favor He says he “no can do.”

But when I unite with my neighbor we’ll make this old world new 
‘Cause we know what the working class can do.

So let’s get together folks That labor with our hands. 
And let’s get together, folks, with brains that understand.

And let’s get together, folks, all across this land, 
And show ‘em what the working class can do.
