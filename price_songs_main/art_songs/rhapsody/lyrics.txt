I am glad daylong for the gift of song
For time and change and sorrow
For the sunset wings and the world end things
Which hang on the edge of tomorrow
I am glad for my heart whose gates apart
Are the entrance place of wonders
Where dreams come in, from the rush and din
Like sheep from the rains and thunder
