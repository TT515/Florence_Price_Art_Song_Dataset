I am so tired waiting for my heart to break
Waiting for tears to heal my soul
For a blessed hand to melt away
The agony within me

Aeons since you went from me
Into an alien world
And still stranger to beauty are all my days
My nights, dark musings of libations
Where once the myrtle grew

I could carry the weight of winter
The glory of autumn nights and days
But oh! I cannot bear the spring
And I am ill unto death, my beloved
Sick with longing, sick with weeping
Waiting for my heart to break
