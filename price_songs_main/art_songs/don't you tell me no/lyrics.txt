Always there's something you cannot get
Maybe the girl that you have just met
Or some sweet baby whom you have lost
Before you stopped to count the cost
There's something I want now

Oh mama, my mama, don't you tell me "No."
Cause mama you see I'm yearning so
Oh mama, sweet mama, my hands won't behave
For your dear charms they creep and crave

Don't scold me, just hold me, and fold me tight, oh tight!
Say, baby I'll lose my mind if you don't treat me kind
So mama, sweet mama, honey to the bee
Is not as sweet as you to me
