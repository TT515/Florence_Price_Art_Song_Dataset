The fog horn's constant deep recurring knell
That seems to haunt the huddled sleeping town
And like a muffled heart to beat far down the coast
Has mazed my mind in magic spell
Here in the warmth and comfort of this room
A shell that holds serenity and peace
The moon intrudes insisting on release of consciousness to where wild seas loom
Deserting the volume that my hands uphold
My mind effeels a strange duality
In part it stays to mock ironically
The rest escapes to entertain the cold
The silver fluid air
The deeper moan
In monotone
