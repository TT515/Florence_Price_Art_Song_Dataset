Yes, I want God' heaven to be mine 
Be mine, be mine,
Yes, I want God' heaven to be mine
Save me, Lord, save me

I hailed my sister
She hailed back to me
The last word I heard her say was
Save me, Lord, save me

I hailed my brother
He hailed back to me
The last word I heard him say was
Save me, Lord, save me

Yes, I want God' heaven to be mine 
Be mine, be mine,
Yes, I want God' heaven to be mine
Save me, Lord, save me

I hailed my father
He hailed back to me
The last word I heard him say was
Save me, Lord, save me

I hailed my mother
She hailed back to me
The last word I heard her say was
Save me, Lord, save me
