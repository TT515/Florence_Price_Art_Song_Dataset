Oh, Peter, go ring them bells,
Peter, go ring them bells,
Peter, go ring them bells,
I heard from heaven today.

I wonder where my mother is gone,
I wonder where my mother is gone,
I wonder where my mother is gone,
I heard from heaven today.

I heard from heaven today,
I heard from heaven today,
I thank God, and I thank you, too.
I heard from heaven today.

Oh, Peter, go ring them bells,
Peter, go ring them bells,
Peter, go ring them bells,
I heard from heaven today.
