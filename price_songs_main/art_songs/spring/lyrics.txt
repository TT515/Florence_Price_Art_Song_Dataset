There are promise and pleasure and hope in the spring,
That beckon, and reckon the future. I know.
The bud and the bee, swaying low on the lea,
The dove cooing late.
To his nesting mate.
In a dream of ecstasy
 
There are laughter and magic and joy in the spring,
That capture, enrapture my heart. I know.
A lilt on the breeze, That is tossed by the trees,
Which doth for me weave
Like a thrush above
A song of ecstasy.
 
Ah! There are madness and gladness and nothing of sadness.
That will me and thrill me and fill me I know
Life and its weal are to give and to feel
The soul that can ache,
The heart that can break.
With a pain of ecstasy.
