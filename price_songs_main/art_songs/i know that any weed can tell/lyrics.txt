I know that any weed can tell
And any red leaf knows
That what is lost is found again
To blossom in a rose

The weakest is the strongest too
For any moss has shown
How strong its frailest fingers are 
To split the biggest stone

And so I go my quiet way
As any quiet thing
I know that weed and moss too well
Too well to be afraid to sing
