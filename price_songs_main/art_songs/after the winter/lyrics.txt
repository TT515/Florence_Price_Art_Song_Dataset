Some day when trees have shed their leaves
And against the morning's white
The shivering boughs beneath the caves
Have sheltered for the night
We'll turn our faces Southward, love
Toward the summer isle
Where bamboos spire the shafted grave
And wide-mouth orchids smile
And we will seek the quiet hill
Where towers the cotton tree
And leaps the laughing crystal rill
And works the droning tree
And we will build a cottage there
Beside an open glade
With black ribbed bluebells blowing near
And ferns that never fade
