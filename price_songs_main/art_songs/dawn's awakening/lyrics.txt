I stood on the hill at daybreak and watched the rising sun
I saw the night in its passing and the day that had just begun
I stood on a hill at a morning tide and watched the break of day
I saw the stars in the heavens, as the faded slowly away
I saw the sun in its splendor rise over the hazy mists
I felt the warmth of its shining rays, as the earth it fondly kissed
I saw the sheep and the shepherd rise from a night of repose
I saw all the beauties of nature and the dew shine like pearls on the rose
I saw the fields and the fires, I saw the river below
I saw the ships in the harbor, and wondered whither they'd go
I saw in the distance a city where slumbered the wicked and just
Close by on the hill side a graveyard where soon must mingle their dust
I saw the church in the valley where worshipped the old and young
And I heard the bells in its tower as a heavenly anthem they sang
I listened again for the voices that rang in praise of our Lord
The hilltops echoed the music with hosannas in sweetest accord
