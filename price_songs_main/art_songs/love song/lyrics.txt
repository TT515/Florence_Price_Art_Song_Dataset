Winter, summer, snow or shine
Hits all the same to me
If only I can call you mine
And keep you by my side
Hardship, frolic grief or care
Content by night and day
If only I can see you where you 
Wait beside the way
Living, dying, smiles or tears
My soul will still be free
If only through the coming years
You walk the world with me
Birdsong, breeze wail, tune or moan
What puny things they'll be
If when I seeming all alone
I know your heart's with me
