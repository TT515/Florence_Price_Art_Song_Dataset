On a moonlit night you said "I do."
And now you're complaining every day
Because your dreams did not come true
In every sort of way
And when I ask you why 'tis so
You say "I thought I loved you Joe
But now I see the reason why
'Twas only the moonlight"

Don't blame it on the moonlight
If you found regret
Don't blame it on the moonlight
If you fume and fret
Because your dreams did not come true
Just blame yourself for saying "I do"
When you know you did not love me true

Don't blame it on the moonlight
For 'tis all too late
Don't blame it on the moonlight
In your debate
Tru to be true forget the past
Let your mistakes now be the last
Don't blame it on the moonlight 'cause you said I do
