They put ma body in the ground,
Ma soul went flyin' o' the town,

Went flyin' to the stars an' moon
A-shoutin', God, I's comin' soon.

O Jesus!

Lord in heaven,
Crown on His head,
Says don't be 'fraid
Cause you ain't dead.

Kind Jesus!

An' now I'm settin' clean an' bright
In the sweet o' ma Lord's sightâ€”
Clean an' bright,
Clean an' bright.
