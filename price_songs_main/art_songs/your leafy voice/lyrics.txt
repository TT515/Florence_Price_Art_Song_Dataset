May I, who so love woodlands
When my body goes
Back to nourish grasses
The nettle or the rose
Find your hand outstretched to guide
My bewildered spirit back
Down the pathways of the wind
And the blinding zodiac
To some wooded hillside slope
Such as now I see
And crying in your leafy voice
Open sesame
Bid my homing spirit
Welcome to a tree
